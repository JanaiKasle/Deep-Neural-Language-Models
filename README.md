 1.	Purpose: The study aims to compare the effectiveness of these models in generating text, considering factors like model design, training methods, and performance in various text creation scenarios.
 2.	Focus Areas: The paper discusses issues like the vanishing gradient problem, model complexity versus performance, and how well each model adapts to different domains like chatbots, content creation, and summarization.
 3.	Models Examined:
o	CNN: Typically used for image processing but also applied to text generation.
o	RNN: Handles sequential data well but can suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients.
o	LSTM: An advanced type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and is effective at recognizing long-range dependencies.
o	GRU: A variant of RNN that combines memory and computation more efficiently, often performing better than LSTM in some cases.
 4.	Findings: The results show that GRU outperforms the other models (CNN, RNN, LSTM) in terms of weighted average, accuracy, loss, and perplexity when generating text.

 5.	Applications: The paper also highlights the growing importance of AI in text generation across various fields like education, media, and e-commerce, with tools likeChatGPT and Jasper AI being mentioned.

 6.	Literature Review: The document includes a detailed literature review, comparing various studies on deep neural language models and their effectiveness in different text generation tasks.
